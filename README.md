1.“What challenges did you encounter in downloading Android Studio?”

During the installation of Android Studio, I encountered several challenges. The download process took a long time because of the large file size and slow internet connection. I also needed to free up additional disk space since Android Studio, along with the SDKs and emulator, requires several gigabytes of storage. Another difficulty was setting up the emulator, as it consumed a lot of memory and made my laptop run slower than usual. Despite these issues, I was able to complete the installation and run Android Studio successfully.

2."What did you learn about android app structure?"

I learned that an Android app has a well-organized structure that separates code, resources, and configurations. The Java or Kotlin folder contains the source code where the logic of the app is written. The res folder stores resources such as layouts, images, and strings, making it easier to manage and update the user interface without changing the code. The AndroidManifest.xml file plays an important role because it declares essential information about the app, such as its name, permissions, and activities. Lastly, the Gradle build files handle dependencies and project settings. Understanding this structure made it clearer how the different parts of an app work together to create a functional Android application.
